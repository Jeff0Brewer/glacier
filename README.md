Scientists in the Seismological Laboratory are seeking to understand glacier flow and variability at different timescales. In our collaboration with them, we sought to visually represent the movement of ocean tides and inland Antarctic ice streams over varying timescales.

We created an interactive tool that generates a unified visualization of velocity in space and time and supports exploration of quantitative data.
